# Stock-analysis
Steve´s stock analysis by using VBA

## Overview of the Project 
We will help Steve to analyze stock market by:
Creating a Visual Basic macro that can output values we need for our analysis, we need a code that can analyze, read and change cell values, and also we need that the formatting of the spreadsheets can be done using a macro Prograaming structure.
We can get the analysis by creating loops and conditionals to direct logic flow 
We are analyzing the yearly stock data to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Purpose of the Project 
We are analyzing the yearly stock data to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
For this second challenge, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataser. Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
